What is OpenLoad?
=================

OpenLoad is a tool for load testing web applications. It aims to be easy to
use and providing near real-time performance measurements of the application
under test. This is particulary useful when you are doing optimization as
you can see the impact of your changes almost immediately.

Building OpenLoad
=================

- Linux
Please see the INSTALL file

- Win32
Run the make-win32.bat file, which will compile the Debug version
(src/Debug/openload.exe). Alternatively you can open the workspace
(openload.dsw) in the VisualC IDE and build from there.

How do I use it?
================

OpenLoad is (currently) a commandline tool, that you execute from a
prompt like this:

 openload http://testapp.site.com 10

The 2 parameters are:

 * The url of the web page you want to test.
 * Number of simultanous clients to simulate. This is optional and
   defaults to 5

You will then get output similar to this:

 >openload http://192.168.0.11/perl/test.pl 10
 URL: http://192.168.0.11/perl/test.pl
 Clients: 10
 MATPS 126.62, TPS 126.62, count      127
 MATPS 132.84, TPS 188.81, count      316
 MATPS 139.52, TPS 199.60, count      516
 MATPS 146.65, TPS 210.89, count      729
 MATPS 150.37, TPS 183.82, count      913
 MATPS 158.46, TPS 231.31, count     1145
 MATPS 163.62, TPS 210.00, count     1355
 MATPS 173.00, TPS 257.49, count     1613
 MATPS 179.78, TPS 240.76, count     1854
 MATPS 184.95, TPS 231.54, count     2086
 MATPS 189.06, TPS 226.00, count     2312
 MATPS 189.75, TPS 196.00, count     2508
 Total TPS: 203.80

Where:

 * MATPS is a 20 second moving average of TPS.
 * TPS (Transactions Per Second) is the number of completed requests
   during that second.
 * Count is the total number of completed requests.
 * Total TPS is the average TPS for the whole run, i.e. (Total completed
   requests) / (Total elapsed time).

Note: you stop the run by pressing Enter.
